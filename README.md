# ConceptVectors Benchmark
**ConceptVectors Benchmark for 2024 NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks Track submission.**

This repository contains the data for the ConceptVectors Benchmark and the code for the experiments in our paper titled **[Intrinsic Evaluation of Unlearning Using Parametric Knowledge Traces]**

Our benchmark is also available on HuggingFace Datasets: https://huggingface.co/datasets/YihuaiHong/ConceptVectors

> **Abstract**
> The task of "unlearning'' certain concepts in large language models (LLMs) has attracted immense attention recently, due to its importance for mitigating undesirable model behaviours, such as the generation of harmful, private, or incorrect information. Current protocols to evaluate unlearning methods largely rely on behavioral tests, without monitoring the presence of unlearned knowledge within the model's parameters. This residual knowledge can be adversarially exploited to recover the erased information post-unlearning. We argue that unlearning should also be evaluated internally, by considering changes in the parametric knowledge traces of the unlearned concepts. To this end, we propose a general methodology for eliciting directions in the parameter space (termed ''concept vectors'') that encode concrete concepts, and construct ConceptVectors, a benchmark dataset containing hundreds of common concepts and their parametric knowledge traces within two open-source LLMs. Evaluation on ConceptVectors shows that existing unlearning methods minimally impact concept vectors, while directly ablating these vectors demonstrably removes the associated knowledge from the LLMs and significantly reduces their susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. Our results highlight limitations in behavioral-based unlearning evaluations and call for future work to include parametric-based evaluations. To support this, we release our code and benchmark at https://github.com/yihuaihong/ConceptVectors.
