      "Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental and behavioral disorder in which an individual has intrusive thoughts (an obsession) and feels the need to perform certain routines (compulsions) repeatedly to relieve the distress caused by the obsession, to the extent where it impairs general function.\n",
      "Obsessions are persistent unwanted thoughts, mental images, or urges that generate feelings of anxiety, disgust, or discomfort. Some common obsessions include fear of contamination, obsession with symmetry, the fear of acting blasphemously, the sufferer's sexual orientation, and the fear of possibly harming others or themselves. Compulsions are repeated actions or routines that occur in response to obsessions to achieve a relief from anxiety. Common compulsions include excessive hand washing, cleaning, counting, ordering, repeating, avoiding triggers, hoarding, neutralizing, seeking assurance, praying, and checking things. People with OCD may only perform mental compulsions such as needing to know or remember things. While this is sometimes referred to as primarily obsessional obsessive–compulsive disorder (Pure O), it is also considered a misnomer due to associated mental compulsions and reassurance seeking behaviors that are consistent with OCD.\n",
      "Compulsions occur often and typically take up at least one hour per day, impairing one's quality of life. Compulsions cause relief in the moment, but cause obsessions to grow over time due to the repeated reward-seeking behavior of completing the ritual for relief. Many adults with OCD are aware that their compulsions do not make sense, but they still perform them to relieve the distress caused by obsessions. For this reason, thoughts and behaviors in OCD are usually considered egodystonic. In contrast, thoughts and behaviors in obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) are usually considered egosyntonic, helping differentiate between the two.\n",

       " 'wikipedia_content': 'Feng shui (  or ), sometimes called Chinese geomancy, is a traditional practice that originated in Ancient China and claims to use energy forces to harmonize individuals with their surrounding environment. The term feng shui means, literally, \"wind-water\" (i.e., fluid). From ancient times, landscapes and bodies of water were thought to direct the flow of the universal Qi – \"cosmic current\" or energy – through places and structures. More broadly, feng shui includes astronomical, astrological, architectural, cosmological, geographical, and topographical dimensions.\\nHistorically, as well as in many parts of the contemporary Chinese world, feng shui was used to choose the orientation of buildings, dwellings, and spiritually significant structures such as tombs. One scholar writes that in contemporary Western societies, however, \"feng shui tends to be reduced to interior design for health and wealth. It has become increasingly visible through \\'feng shui consultants\\' and corporate architects who charge large sums of money for their analysis, advice and design.\"\\nFeng shui has been identified as both non-scientific and pseudoscientific by scientists and philosophers, and it has been described as a paradigmatic example of pseudoscience. It exhibits a number of classic pseudoscientific aspects, such as making claims about the functioning of the world that are not amenable to testing with the scientific method.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Origins ===\\nThe Yangshao and Hongshan cultures provide the earliest known evidence for the use of feng shui. Until the invention of the magnetic compass, feng shui relied on astronomy to find correlations between humans and the universe.\\nIn 4000 BC, the doors of dwellings in Banpo were aligned with the asterism Yingshi just after the winter solstice—this sited the homes for solar gain. During the Zhou era, Yingshi was known as Ding and it was used to indicate the appropriate time to build a capital city, according to the Shijing. The late Yangshao site at Dadiwan (c. 3500–3000 BC) includes a palace-like building (F901) at its center. The building faces south and borders a large plaza. It stands on a north–south axis with another building that apparently housed communal activities. Regional communities may have used the complex. \\nA grave at Puyang (around 4000 BC) that contains mosaics— a Chinese star map of the Dragon and Tiger asterisms and Beidou (the Big Dipper, Ladle or Bushel)— is oriented along a north–south axis. The presence of both round and square shapes in the Puyang tomb, at Hongshan ceremonial centers and at the late Longshan settlement at Lutaigang,\\nsuggests that gaitian cosmography (heaven-round, earth-square) existed in Chinese society long before it appeared in the Zhoubi Suanjing.\\nCosmography that bears a resemblance to modern feng shui devices and formulas appears on a piece of jade unearthed at Hanshan and dated around 3000 BC. Archaeologist Li Xueqin links the design to the liuren astrolabe, zhinan zhen and luopan.\\nBeginning with palatial structures at Erlitou, all capital cities of China followed rules of feng shui for their design and layout. During the Zhou era, the Kaogong ji (Chinese: 考工記; \"Manual of Crafts\") codified these rules. The carpenter\\'s manual Lu ban jing (魯班經; \"Lu ban\\'s manuscript\") codified rules for builders. Graves and tombs also followed rules of feng shui from Puyang to Mawangdui and beyond. From the earliest records, the structures of the graves and dwellings seem to have followed the same rules.\\n\\n\\n=== Early instruments and techniques ===\\n\\nSome of the foundations of feng shui go back more than 3,500 years before the invention of the magnetic compass. It originated in Chinese astronomy. Some current techniques can be traced to Neolithic China, while others were added later (most notably the Han dynasty, the Tang, the Song, and the Ming).\\nThe astronomical history of feng shui is evident in the development of instruments and techniques. According to the Zhouli, the original feng shui instrument may have been a gnomon. Chinese used circumpolar stars to determine the north–south axis of settlements. This technique explains why Shang palaces at Xiaotun lie 10° east of due north. In some of the cases, as Paul Wheatley observed, they bisected the angle between the directions of the rising and setting sun to find north. This technique provided the more precise alignments of the Shang walls at Yanshi and Zhengzhou. Rituals for using a feng shui instrument required a diviner to examine current sky phenomena to set the device and adjust their position in relation to the device.\\nThe oldest examples of instruments used for feng shui are liuren astrolabes, also known as shi. These consist of a lacquered, two-sided board with astronomical sightlines. The earliest examples of liuren astrolabes have been unearthed from tombs that date between 278 BC and 209 BC. Along with divination for Da Liu Ren the boards were commonly used to chart the motion of Taiyi (Pole star) through the nine palaces.  The markings on a liuren/shi and the first magnetic compasses are virtually identical.\\nThe magnetic compass was used for feng shui since its invention.  Traditional feng shui instrumentation consists of the Luopan or the earlier south-pointing spoon (指南針 zhinan zhen)—though a conventional compass could suffice if one understood the differences. Not to be confused with the South-pointing chariot which was used for navigation.  A feng shui ruler (a later invention) may also be employed.\\n\\n\\n=== Later history ===\\nAfter the Song dynasty, divination began to decline as a political institution and instead became an increasingly private affair. Many feng shui experts and diviners sold their services to the public market, allowing feng shui to quickly grow in popularity.\\nDuring the Late Qing dynasty, feng shui became immensely popular. Widespread destitution and increasing government despotism led to feng shui becoming more widely practiced in rural areas. The Qing dynasty attempted to crack down on heterodoxy following the White Lotus Rebellion and Taiping Revolt, but feng shui\\'s decentralization made it difficult to suppress in popular and elite circles.\\nUnder China\\'s Century of Humiliation, feng shui began to receive implicit government encouragement as a method of colonial resistance. Through the militarization of the countryside, the local gentry used feng shui to justify and promote popular attacks against missionaries and colonial infrastructure. This allowed local elites and government officials to bypass foreign extraterritoriality and maintain local sovereignty. This, in addition to the cultural aspects of feng shui, made the practice a powerful expression of demarcation between foreign and Chinese identities.\\nFollowing the rise of Communist China, religion and traditional cosmology were suppressed more than ever, in the name of ideological purity. Decentralized heterodoxies, like feng shui, were best adapted to survive this period. As a result, feng shui became one of the only alternative forms of thought within the Chinese countryside. Feng shui experts remained highly sought after, in spite of numerous campaigns to suppress the practice.\\nIt was only after China\\'s Reform and Opening-Up that feng shui would see a complete resurgence. As economic liberalization promoted social competition and individualism, feng shui was able to find new footing due to its focus on individualism and amoral justification of social differences.\\n\\n\\n== Foundational concepts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Definition and classification ===\\nFeng shui views good and bad fortune as tangible elements that can be managed through predictable and consistent rules. This involves the management of qi, an imagined form of cosmic \"energy.\" In situating the local environment to maximize good qi, one can optimize their own good fortune. Feng shui holds that one\\'s external environment can affect one\\'s internal state. A goal of the practice is to achieve a \"perfect spot\", a location and an axis in time that can help one achieve a state of shū fú (舒服) or harmony with the universe. \\nTraditional feng shui is inherently a form of ancestor worship. Popular in farming communities for centuries, it was built on the idea that the ghosts of ancestors and other independent, intangible forces, both personal and impersonal, affected the material world, and that these forces needed to be placated through rites and suitable burial places. For a fee, a Feng shui practitioner would identify suitable locations for the living and the dead to achieve shū fú. The primary underlying value was material success for the living.\\nAccording to Stuart Vyse, feng shui is \"a very popular superstition.\" The PRC government has also labeled it as superstitious. Feng shui is classified as a pseudoscience since it exhibits a number of classic pseudoscientific aspects such as making claims about the functioning of the world which are not amenable to testing with the scientific method. It has been identified as both non-scientific and pseudoscientific by scientists and philosophers, and has been described as a paradigmatic example of pseudoscience.\\n\\n\\n=== Qi (ch\\'i) ===\\n\\nQi (气, pronounced \"chee\") is a movable positive or negative life force which plays an essential role in feng shui. The Book of Burial says that burial takes advantage of \"vital qi\".  The goal of feng shui is to take advantage of vital qi by appropriate siting of graves and structures.\\n\\n\\n=== Polarity ===\\nPolarity is expressed in feng shui as yin and yang theory. That is, it is of two parts: one creating an exertion and one receiving the exertion. The development of this theory and its corollary, five phase theory (five element theory), have also been linked with astronomical observations of sunspot.\\nThe Five Elements or Forces (wu xing) – which, according to the Chinese, are metal, earth, fire, water, and wood – are first mentioned in Chinese literature in a chapter of the classic Book of History. They play a very important part in Chinese thought: ‘elements’ meaning generally not so much the actual substances as the forces essential to human life.  Earth is a buffer, or an equilibrium achieved when the polarities cancel each other. While the goal of Chinese medicine is to balance yin and yang in the body, the goal of feng shui has been described as aligning a city, site, building, or object with yin-yang force fields.\\n\\n\\n=== Bagua (eight trigrams) ===\\nEight diagrams known as bagua loom large in feng shui, and both predate their mentions in the I Ching.  The Lo (River) Chart was developed first, and is sometimes associated with Later Heaven arrangement of the bagua. This and the Yellow River Chart (Hetu, sometimes associated with the Earlier Heaven bagua) are linked to astronomical events of the sixth millennium BC, and with the Turtle Calendar from the time of Yao. The Turtle Calendar of Yao (found in the Yaodian section of the Shangshu or Book of Documents) dates to 2300 BC, plus or minus 250 years.\\nIn Yaodian, the cardinal directions are determined by the marker-stars of the mega-constellations known as the Four Celestial Animals:\\n\\nEast: The Azure Dragon (Spring equinox)—Niao (Bird 鳥), α Scorpionis\\nSouth: The Vermilion Bird (Summer solstice)—Huo (Fire 火), α Hydrae\\nWest: The White Tiger (Autumn equinox)—Mǎo (Hair 毛), η Tauri (the Pleiades)\\nNorth: The Black Tortoise (Winter solstice)—Xū (Emptiness, Void 虛), α Aquarii, β Aquarii\\nThe diagrams are also linked with the sifang (four directions) method of divination used during\\nthe Shang dynasty. The sifang is much older, however. It was used at Niuheliang, and figured large in Hongshan culture\\'s astronomy. And it is this area of China that is linked to Yellow Emperor (Huangdi) who allegedly invented the south-pointing spoon (see compass).\\n\\n\\n== Traditional feng shui ==\\nTraditional feng shui is an ancient system based upon the observation of heavenly time and earthly space. Literature, as well as archaeological evidence, provide some idea of the origins and nature of feng shui techniques. Aside from books, there is also a strong oral history. In many cases, masters have passed on their techniques only to selected students or relatives. Modern practitioners of feng shui draw from several branches in their own practices.\\n\\n\\n=== Form Branch ===\\nThe Form Branch is the oldest branch of feng shui. Qing Wuzi in the Han dynasty describes it in the Book of the Tomb and Guo Pu of the Jin dynasty follows up with a more complete description in The Book of Burial.\\nThe Form branch was originally concerned with the location and orientation of tombs (Yin House feng shui), which was of great importance. The branch then progressed to the consideration of homes and other buildings (Yang House feng shui).\\nThe \"form\" in Form branch refers to the shape of the environment, such as mountains, rivers, plateaus, buildings, and general surroundings. It considers the five celestial animals (vermillion phoenix, azure dragon, white tiger, black turtle, and the yellow snake), the yin-yang concept and the traditional five elements (Wu Xing: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water).\\nThe Form branch analyzes the shape of the land and flow of the wind and water to find a place with ideal qi. It also considers the time of important events such as the birth of the resident and the building of the structure.\\n\\n\\n=== Compass Branch ===\\nThe Compass branch is a collection of more recent feng shui techniques based on the Eight Directions, each of which is said to have unique qi. It uses the Luopan, a disc marked with formulas in concentric rings around a magnetic compass.\\nThe Compass Branch includes techniques such as Flying Star and Eight Mansions.\\n\\n\\n== Western forms of feng shui ==\\nMore recent forms of feng shui simplify principles that come from the traditional branches, and focus mainly on the use of the bagua.\\n\\n\\n=== Aspirations Method ===\\nThe Eight Life Aspirations style of feng shui is a simple system which coordinates each of the eight cardinal directions with a specific life aspiration or station such as family, wealth, fame, etc., which come from the Bagua government of the eight aspirations. Life Aspirations is not otherwise a geomantic system.\\n\\n\\n== List of specific feng shui branches ==\\n\\n\\n=== Ti Li (Form Branch) ===\\n\\n\\n==== Popular Xingshi Pai (形勢派) \"forms\" methods ====\\nLuan Tou Pai, 巒頭派, Pinyin: luán tóu pài, (environmental analysis without using a compass)\\nXing Xiang Pai, 形象派 or 形像派, Pinyin: xíng xiàng pài, (Imaging forms)\\nXingfa Pai, 形法派, Pinyin: xíng fǎ pài\\n\\n\\n=== Liiqi Pai (Compass Branch) ===\\n\\n\\n==== Popular Liiqi Pai (理气派) \"Compass\" methods ====\\nSan Yuan Method, 三元派 (Pinyin: sān yuán pài)\\n\\nDragon Gate Eight Formation, 龍門八法 (Pinyin: lóng mén bā fǎ)\\nXuan Kong, 玄空 (time and space methods)\\nXuan Kong Fei Xing 玄空飛星 (Flying Stars methods of time and directions)\\nXuan Kong Da Gua, 玄空大卦 (\"Secret Decree\" or 64 gua relationships)\\nXuan Kong Mi Zi, 玄空秘旨 (Mysterious Space Secret Decree)\\nXuan Kong Liu Fa, 玄空六法 (Mysterious Space Six Techniques)\\nZi Bai Jue, 紫白訣 (Purple White Scroll)\\nSan He Method, 三合派 (environmental analysis using a compass)\\n\\nAccessing Dragon Methods\\nBa Zhai, 八宅 (Eight Mansions)\\nYang Gong Feng Shui, 楊公風水\\nWater Methods, 河洛水法\\nLocal Embrace\\nOthers\\n\\nYin House Feng Shui, 陰宅風水 (Feng Shui for the deceased)\\nFour Pillars of Destiny, 四柱命理 (a form of hemerology)\\nZi Wei Dou Shu, 紫微斗數 (Purple Star Astrology)\\nI-Ching, 易經 (Book of Changes)\\nQi Men Dun Jia, 奇門遁甲 (Mysterious Door Escaping Techniques)\\nDa Liu Ren, 大六壬 (Divination: Big Six Heavenly Yang Water Qi)\\nTai Yi Shen Shu, 太乙神數 (Divination: Tai Yi Magical Calculation Method)\\nDate Selection, 擇日 (Selection of auspicious dates and times for important events)\\nChinese Palmistry, 掌相學 (Destiny reading by palm reading)\\nChinese Face Reading, 面相學 (Destiny reading by face reading)\\nMajor & Minor Wandering Stars (Constellations)\\nFive phases, 五行 (relationship of the five phases or wuxing)\\nBTB Black (Hat) Tantric Buddhist Sect (Westernised or Modern methods not based on Classical teachings)\\nSymbolic Feng Shui, (New Age Feng Shui methods that advocate substitution with symbolic (spiritual, appropriate representation of five elements) objects if natural environment or object/s is/are not available or viable)\\nPierce Method of Feng Shui ( Sometimes Pronounced : Von Shway ) The practice of melding striking with soothing furniture arrangements to promote peace and prosperity\\n\\n\\n== Traditional uses of feng shui ==\\n\\n\\n=== Environmental management ===\\nTraditional feng shui was a system designed to aid rural villages from the effects of weather and natural disaster. As a set of consistent rules, feng shui can facilitate collective consensus on development without the need of centralized leadership. Understanding that one\\'s actions could damage the feng shui and fortunes of the entire village, individuals were incentivized to know these rules and carefully manage the development of their land and resources. This served to prevent the Tragedy of the Commons. When conflict did erupt during development, feng shui experts played an important role in balancing interests and enforcing orderly development.\\nDifferent branches of feng shui were developed and embraced in response to differing local geographies. In southern China, this often resulted in villages located on high hills safe from flooding and erosion, with pooling streams that allow for easy irrigation and drainage, fields downstream fertilized by sewage, and graves located on the highest hills far from water and on otherwise unvaluable farmland. To this degree, feng shui could help communities manage their spaces to match their physical, environmental, and aesthetic needs.\\n\\n\\n=== Conflict resolution ===\\nA core aspect of feng shui has been its understanding of polarity. As opposed to western dualism, in which concepts are completely oppositional and irreconcilable, Chinese polarity sees opposing concepts as constantly changing and inseparable. The result is an emphasis on continual compromise and balance in order to maintain harmony.\\nFeng shui has been observed to play an important role in the mediation of rural conflict. Through its amoral explanation of differential fortunes, feng shui provides a universal set of cosmic rules communities seek to abide by. This can promote community unity while also creating numerous points of polarization. Through the hiring of feng shui experts, disputes between villagers can be peaceably resolved without losing face. In addition, these impersonal cosmic rules help regulate local jealousies over wealth and prestige.\\n\\n\\n=== Community mobilization and political protest ===\\nAs early as the Tang dynasty, the Chinese state recognized the disruptive power popular expressions of feng shui had over government authority. At the community level, feng shui could play an important role in community mobilization and political protest. By elevating a cosmological explanations of events, feng shui allowed for the expression of otherwise impermissible political opinions.\\nDuring the Boxer Rebellion, feng shui was used to justify attacks on western missionaries and colonial infrastructure. Under the perceptions of these infrastructural projects and groups were generating bad feng shui, rebels were able to incite their local communities into revolt against foreign influence.\\nTo a more civil degree, feng shui could facilitate community negotiation. During the development of the Shek Pik Reservoir, feng shui was used to rally the community against the reservoir and hinder construction. It was only after months of difficult negotiations that guaranteed of local oversight, compensation, and resettlement could construction go smoothly. For many communities, feng shui is a method to extract proper deference and compensation from the government.\\n\\n\\n=== Expression of identity ===\\nFeng shui has been described as an egocentric tradition. Because of the nature of fortune, one person\\'s gain comes at another\\'s expense. Thus when compared to the more collectivist traditions of Confucianism, feng shui promotes social competition and the atomization of the family structure. This differentiation has been particularly expressed through excellent siting and the building of bigger homes that can change the local balance of feng shui.\\nFeng shui also helps promote ethnic differentiation. In Southern China, different folk traditions and beliefs guide differing interpretations of feng shui. Through conflicts over burial sites, these contrasting interpretations of feng shui act as an important medium to settle interethnic disputes and define local dynamics.\\n\\n\\n== Contemporary uses of feng shui ==\\n\\nAfter Richard Nixon\\'s visit to the People\\'s Republic of China in 1972, feng shui practices became popular in the United States. Critics warn that claims of scientific validity have proven to be false and that the practices are pseudoscientific. Others charge that it has been reinvented and commercialized by New Age entrepreneurs, or are concerned that much of the traditional theory has been lost in translation, not given proper consideration, frowned upon, or scorned.\\nFeng shui has nonetheless found many uses. Landscape ecologists often find traditional feng shui an interesting study. In many cases, the only remaining patches of Asian old forest  are \"feng shui woods,\" associated with cultural heritage, historical continuity, and the preservation of various flora and fauna species. Some researchers interpret the presence of these woods as indicators that the \"healthy homes,\" sustainability  and environmental components of traditional feng shui should not be easily dismissed. Environmental scientists and landscape architects have researched traditional feng shui and its methodologies. Architects study feng shui as an Asian architectural tradition. Geographers have analyzed the techniques and methods to help locate historical sites in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, and archaeological sites in the American Southwest, concluding that Native Americans also considered astronomy and landscape features.\\nBelievers use it for healing purposes, to guide their businesses, or to create a peaceful atmosphere in their homes, although there is no empirical evidence that it is effective. In particular, they use feng shui in the bedroom, where a number of techniques involving colors and arrangement are thought to promote comfort and peaceful sleep. Some users of feng shui may be trying to gain a sense of security or control, for example by choosing auspicious numbers for their phones or favorable house locations. Their motivation is similar to the reasons that some people consult fortune-tellers.\\nIn 2005, Hong Kong Disneyland acknowledged feng shui as an important part of Chinese culture by shifting the main gate by twelve degrees in their building plans. This was among actions suggested by the planner of architecture and design at Walt Disney Imagineering, Wing Chao. At Singapore Polytechnic and other institutions, professionals including engineers, architects, property agents and interior designers, take courses on feng shui and divination every year, a number of whom become part-time or full-time feng shui consultants.\\n\\n\\n== Criticisms ==\\n\\n\\n=== Traditional feng shui ===\\nMatteo Ricci (1552–1610), one of the founding fathers of Jesuit China missions, may have been the first European to write about feng shui practices. His account in De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas tells about feng shui masters (geologi, in Latin) studying prospective construction sites or grave sites \"with reference to the head and the tail and the feet of the particular dragons which are supposed to dwell beneath that spot.\" As a Catholic missionary, Ricci strongly criticized the \"recondite science\" of geomancy along with astrology as yet another superstitio absurdissima of the heathens: \"What could be more absurd than their imagining that the safety of a family, honors, and their entire existence must depend upon such trifles as a door being opened from one side or another, as rain falling into a courtyard from the right or from the left, a window opened here or there, or one roof being higher than another?\"\\nVictorian-era commentators on feng shui were generally ethnocentric, and as such skeptical and derogatory of what they knew of feng shui. In 1896, at a meeting of the Educational Association of China, Rev. P. W. Pitcher railed at the \"rottenness of the whole scheme of Chinese architecture,\" and urged fellow missionaries \"to erect unabashedly Western edifices of several stories and with towering spires in order to destroy nonsense about fung-shuy.\"\\n\\nAfter the founding of the People\\'s Republic of China in 1949, feng shui was officially considered a \"feudalistic superstitious practice\" and a \"social evil\" according to the state\\'s ideology and was discouraged and even banned outright at times. Feng shui remained popular in Hong Kong, and also in the Republic of China (Taiwan), where traditional culture was not suppressed.\\nDuring the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) feng shui was classified as one of the so-called Four Olds that were to be wiped out. Feng shui practitioners were beaten and abused by Red Guards and their works burned. After the death of Mao Zedong and the end of the Cultural Revolution, the official attitude became more tolerant but restrictions on feng shui practice are still in place in today\\'s China. It is illegal in the PRC today to register feng shui consultation as a business and similarly advertising feng shui practice is banned. There have been frequent crackdowns on feng shui practitioners on the grounds of \"promoting feudalistic superstitions\" such as one in Qingdao in early 2006 when the city\\'s business and industrial administration office shut down an art gallery converted into a feng shui practice. Some officials who had consulted feng shui were terminated and expelled from the Communist Party.\\nIn 21st century mainland China less than one-third of the population believe in feng shui, and the proportion of believers among young urban Chinese is said to be even lower. Chinese academics permitted to research feng shui are anthropologists or architects by profession, studying the history of feng shui or historical feng shui theories behind the design of heritage buildings. They include Cai Dafeng, vice-president of Fudan University.  Learning in order to practice feng shui is still somewhat considered taboo. Nevertheless, it is reported that feng shui has gained adherents among Communist Party officials according to a BBC Chinese news commentary in 2006, and since the beginning of Chinese economic reforms the number of feng shui practitioners is increasing.\\n\\n\\n=== Contemporary feng shui ===\\nOne critic called the situation of feng shui in today\\'s world \"ludicrous and confusing,\" asking \"Do we really believe that mirrors and flutes are going to change people\\'s tendencies in any lasting and meaningful way?\" He called for much further study or \"we will all go down the tubes because of our inability to match our exaggerated claims with lasting changes.\" Robert T. Carroll sums up the charges:\\n\\n...feng shui has become an aspect of interior decorating in the Western world and alleged masters of feng shui now hire themselves out for hefty sums to tell people such as Donald Trump which way his doors and other things should hang. Feng shui has also become another New Age \"energy\" scam with arrays of metaphysical products...offered for sale to help you improve your health, maximize your potential, and guarantee fulfillment of some fortune cookie philosophy.\\nSkeptics charge that evidence for its effectiveness is based primarily upon anecdote and users are often offered conflicting advice from different practitioners, though feng shui practitioners use these differences as evidence of variations in practice or different branches of thought. A critical analyst concluded that \"Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork.\" Another objection was to the compass, a traditional tool for choosing favorable locations for property or burials. Critics point out that the compass degrees are often inaccurate because solar winds disturb the electromagnetic field of the Earth. Magnetic North on the compass will be inaccurate because true magnetic north fluctuates.\\nThe American magicians Penn and Teller dedicated an episode of their Bullshit! television show to criticize the acceptance of feng shui in the Western world as science. They devised a test in which the same dwelling was visited by five different feng shui consultants: each produced a different opinion about the dwelling, showing there is no consistency in the professional practice of feng shui.\\nFeng shui is criticized by Christians around the world. Some have argued that it is \"entirely inconsistent with Christianity to believe that harmony and balance result from the manipulation and channeling of nonphysical forces or energies, or that such can be done by means of the proper placement of physical objects. Such techniques, in fact, belong to the world of sorcery.\"\\nFeng shui practitioners in China have found officials that are considered superstitious and corrupt easily interested, despite official disapproval. In one instance, in 2009, county officials in Gansu, on the advice of feng shui practitioners, spent $732,000 to haul a 369-ton \"spirit rock\" to the county seat to ward off \"bad luck.\" Feng shui may require social influence or money because experts, architecture or design changes, and moving from place to place is expensive. Less influential or less wealthy people lose faith in feng shui, saying that it is a game only for the wealthy. Others, however, practice less expensive forms of feng shui, including hanging special (but cheap) mirrors, forks, or woks in doorways to deflect negative energy.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Sources ==\\n\\n\\n=== Books ===\\nAllan, Sarah (1991).

       " 'wikipedia_content': 'Feng shui (  or ), sometimes called Chinese geomancy, is a traditional practice that originated in Ancient China and claims to use energy forces to harmonize individuals with their surrounding environment. The term feng shui means, literally, \"wind-water\" (i.e., fluid). From ancient times, landscapes and bodies of water were thought to direct the flow of the universal Qi – \"cosmic current\" or energy – through places and structures. More broadly, feng shui includes astronomical, astrological, architectural, cosmological, geographical, and topographical dimensions.\\nHistorically, as well as in many parts of the contemporary Chinese world, feng shui was used to choose the orientation of buildings, dwellings, and spiritually significant structures such as tombs. One scholar writes that in contemporary Western societies, however, \"feng shui tends to be reduced to interior design for health and wealth. It has become increasingly visible through \\'feng shui consultants\\' and corporate architects who charge large sums of money for their analysis, advice and design.\"\\nFeng shui has been identified as both non-scientific and pseudoscientific by scientists and philosophers, and it has been described as a paradigmatic example of pseudoscience. It exhibits a number of classic pseudoscientific aspects, such as making claims about the functioning of the world that are not amenable to testing with the scientific method.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Origins ===\\nThe Yangshao and Hongshan cultures provide the earliest known evidence for the use of feng shui. Until the invention of the magnetic compass, feng shui relied on astronomy to find correlations between humans and the universe.\\nIn 4000 BC, the doors of dwellings in Banpo were aligned with the asterism Yingshi just after the winter solstice—this sited the homes for solar gain. During the Zhou era, Yingshi was known as Ding and it was used to indicate the appropriate time to build a capital city, according to the Shijing. The late Yangshao site at Dadiwan (c. 3500–3000 BC) includes a palace-like building (F901) at its center. The building faces south and borders a large plaza. It stands on a north–south axis with another building that apparently housed communal activities. Regional communities may have used the complex. \\nA grave at Puyang (around 4000 BC) that contains mosaics— a Chinese star map of the Dragon and Tiger asterisms and Beidou (the Big Dipper, Ladle or Bushel)— is oriented along a north–south axis. The presence of both round and square shapes in the Puyang tomb, at Hongshan ceremonial centers and at the late Longshan settlement at Lutaigang,\\nsuggests that gaitian cosmography (heaven-round, earth-square) existed in Chinese society long before it appeared in the Zhoubi Suanjing.\\nCosmography that bears a resemblance to modern feng shui devices and formulas appears on a piece of jade unearthed at Hanshan and dated around 3000 BC. Archaeologist Li Xueqin links the design to the liuren astrolabe, zhinan zhen and luopan.\\nBeginning with palatial structures at Erlitou, all capital cities of China followed rules of feng shui for their design and layout. During the Zhou era, the Kaogong ji (Chinese: 考工記; \"Manual of Crafts\") codified these rules. The carpenter\\'s manual Lu ban jing (魯班經; \"Lu ban\\'s manuscript\") codified rules for builders. Graves and tombs also followed rules of feng shui from Puyang to Mawangdui and beyond. From the earliest records, the structures of the graves and dwellings seem to have followed the same rules.\\n\\n\\n=== Early instruments and techniques ===\\n\\nSome of the foundations of feng shui go back more than 3,500 years before the invention of the magnetic compass. It originated in Chinese astronomy. Some current techniques can be traced to Neolithic China, while others were added later (most notably the Han dynasty, the Tang, the Song, and the Ming).\\nThe astronomical history of feng shui is evident in the development of instruments and techniques. According to the Zhouli, the original feng shui instrument may have been a gnomon. Chinese used circumpolar stars to determine the north–south axis of settlements. This technique explains why Shang palaces at Xiaotun lie 10° east of due north. In some of the cases, as Paul Wheatley observed, they bisected the angle between the directions of the rising and setting sun to find north. This technique provided the more precise alignments of the Shang walls at Yanshi and Zhengzhou. Rituals for using a feng shui instrument required a diviner to examine current sky phenomena to set the device and adjust their position in relation to the device.\\nThe oldest examples of instruments used for feng shui are liuren astrolabes, also known as shi. These consist of a lacquered, two-sided board with astronomical sightlines. The earliest examples of liuren astrolabes have been unearthed from tombs that date between 278 BC and 209 BC. Along with divination for Da Liu Ren the boards were commonly used to chart the motion of Taiyi (Pole star) through the nine palaces.  The markings on a liuren/shi and the first magnetic compasses are virtually identical.\\nThe magnetic compass was used for feng shui since its invention.  Traditional feng shui instrumentation consists of the Luopan or the earlier south-pointing spoon (指南針 zhinan zhen)—though a conventional compass could suffice if one understood the differences. Not to be confused with the South-pointing chariot which was used for navigation.  A feng shui ruler (a later invention) may also be employed.\\n\\n\\n=== Later history ===\\nAfter the Song dynasty, divination began to decline as a political institution and instead became an increasingly private affair. Many feng shui experts and diviners sold their services to the public market, allowing feng shui to quickly grow in popularity.\\nDuring the Late Qing dynasty, feng shui became immensely popular. Widespread destitution and increasing government despotism led to feng shui becoming more widely practiced in rural areas. The Qing dynasty attempted to crack down on heterodoxy following the White Lotus Rebellion and Taiping Revolt, but feng shui\\'s decentralization made it difficult to suppress in popular and elite circles.\\nUnder China\\'s Century of Humiliation, feng shui began to receive implicit government encouragement as a method of colonial resistance. Through the militarization of the countryside, the local gentry used feng shui to justify and promote popular attacks against missionaries and colonial infrastructure. This allowed local elites and government officials to bypass foreign extraterritoriality and maintain local sovereignty. This, in addition to the cultural aspects of feng shui, made the practice a powerful expression of demarcation between foreign and Chinese identities.\\nFollowing the rise of Communist China, religion and traditional cosmology were suppressed more than ever, in the name of ideological purity. Decentralized heterodoxies, like feng shui, were best adapted to survive this period. As a result, feng shui became one of the only alternative forms of thought within the Chinese countryside. Feng shui experts remained highly sought after, in spite of numerous campaigns to suppress the practice.\\nIt was only after China\\'s Reform and Opening-Up that feng shui would see a complete resurgence. As economic liberalization promoted social competition and individualism, feng shui was able to find new footing due to its focus on individualism and amoral justification of social differences.\\n\\n\\n== Foundational concepts ==\\n\\n\\n=== Definition and classification ===\\nFeng shui views good and bad fortune as tangible elements that can be managed through predictable and consistent rules. This involves the management of qi, an imagined form of cosmic \"energy.\" In situating the local environment to maximize good qi, one can optimize their own good fortune. Feng shui holds that one\\'s external environment can affect one\\'s internal state. A goal of the practice is to achieve a \"perfect spot\", a location and an axis in time that can help one achieve a state of shū fú (舒服) or harmony with the universe. \\nTraditional feng shui is inherently a form of ancestor worship. Popular in farming communities for centuries, it was built on the idea that the ghosts of ancestors and other independent, intangible forces, both personal and impersonal, affected the material world, and that these forces needed to be placated through rites and suitable burial places. For a fee, a Feng shui practitioner would identify suitable locations for the living and the dead to achieve shū fú. The primary underlying value was material success for the living.\\nAccording to Stuart Vyse, feng shui is \"a very popular superstition.\" The PRC government has also labeled it as superstitious. Feng shui is classified as a pseudoscience since it exhibits a number of classic pseudoscientific aspects such as making claims about the functioning of the world which are not amenable to testing with the scientific method. It has been identified as both non-scientific and pseudoscientific by scientists and philosophers, and has been described as a paradigmatic example of pseudoscience.\\n\\n\\n=== Qi (ch\\'i) ===\\n\\nQi (气, pronounced \"chee\") is a movable positive or negative life force which plays an essential role in feng shui. The Book of Burial says that burial takes advantage of \"vital qi\".  The goal of feng shui is to take advantage of vital qi by appropriate siting of graves and structures.\\n\\n\\n=== Polarity ===\\nPolarity is expressed in feng shui as yin and yang theory. That is, it is of two parts: one creating an exertion and one receiving the exertion. The development of this theory and its corollary, five phase theory (five element theory), have also been linked with astronomical observations of sunspot.\\nThe Five Elements or Forces (wu xing) – which, according to the Chinese, are metal, earth, fire, water, and wood – are first mentioned in Chinese literature in a chapter of the classic Book of History. They play a very important part in Chinese thought: ‘elements’ meaning generally not so much the actual substances as the forces essential to human life.  Earth is a buffer, or an equilibrium achieved when the polarities cancel each other. While the goal of Chinese medicine is to balance yin and yang in the body, the goal of feng shui has been described as aligning a city, site, building, or object with yin-yang force fields.\\n\\n\\n=== Bagua (eight trigrams) ===\\nEight diagrams known as bagua loom large in feng shui, and both predate their mentions in the I Ching.  The Lo (River) Chart was developed first, and is sometimes associated with Later Heaven arrangement of the bagua. This and the Yellow River Chart (Hetu, sometimes associated with the Earlier Heaven bagua) are linked to astronomical events of the sixth millennium BC, and with the Turtle Calendar from the time of Yao. The Turtle Calendar of Yao (found in the Yaodian section of the Shangshu or Book of Documents) dates to 2300 BC, plus or minus 250 years.\\nIn Yaodian, the cardinal directions are determined by the marker-stars of the mega-constellations known as the Four Celestial Animals:\\n\\nEast: The Azure Dragon (Spring equinox)—Niao (Bird 鳥), α Scorpionis\\nSouth: The Vermilion Bird (Summer solstice)—Huo (Fire 火), α Hydrae\\nWest: The White Tiger (Autumn equinox)—Mǎo (Hair 毛), η Tauri (the Pleiades)\\nNorth: The Black Tortoise (Winter solstice)—Xū (Emptiness, Void 虛), α Aquarii, β Aquarii\\nThe diagrams are also linked with the sifang (four directions) method of divination used during\\nthe Shang dynasty. The sifang is much older, however. It was used at Niuheliang, and figured large in Hongshan culture\\'s astronomy. And it is this area of China that is linked to Yellow Emperor (Huangdi) who allegedly invented the south-pointing spoon (see compass).\\n\\n\\n== Traditional feng shui ==\\nTraditional feng shui is an ancient system based upon the observation of heavenly time and earthly space. Literature, as well as archaeological evidence, provide some idea of the origins and nature of feng shui techniques. Aside from books, there is also a strong oral history. In many cases, masters have passed on their techniques only to selected students or relatives. Modern practitioners of feng shui draw from several branches in their own practices.\\n\\n\\n=== Form Branch ===\\nThe Form Branch is the oldest branch of feng shui. Qing Wuzi in the Han dynasty describes it in the Book of the Tomb and Guo Pu of the Jin dynasty follows up with a more complete description in The Book of Burial.\\nThe Form branch was originally concerned with the location and orientation of tombs (Yin House feng shui), which was of great importance. The branch then progressed to the consideration of homes and other buildings (Yang House feng shui).\\nThe \"form\" in Form branch refers to the shape of the environment, such as mountains, rivers, plateaus, buildings, and general surroundings. It considers the five celestial animals (vermillion phoenix, azure dragon, white tiger, black turtle, and the yellow snake), the yin-yang concept and the traditional five elements (Wu Xing: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water).\\nThe Form branch analyzes the shape of the land and flow of the wind and water to find a place with ideal qi. It also considers the time of important events such as the birth of the resident and the building of the structure.\\n\\n\\n=== Compass Branch ===\\nThe Compass branch is a collection of more recent feng shui techniques based on the Eight Directions, each of which is said to have unique qi. It uses the Luopan, a disc marked with formulas in concentric rings around a magnetic compass.\\nThe Compass Branch includes techniques such as Flying Star and Eight Mansions.\\n\\n\\n== Western forms of feng shui ==\\nMore recent forms of feng shui simplify principles that come from the traditional branches, and focus mainly on the use of the bagua.\\n\\n\\n=== Aspirations Method ===\\nThe Eight Life Aspirations style of feng shui is a simple system which coordinates each of the eight cardinal directions with a specific life aspiration or station such as family, wealth, fame, etc., which come from the Bagua government of the eight aspirations. Life Aspirations is not otherwise a geomantic system.\\n\\n\\n== List of specific feng shui branches ==\\n\\n\\n=== Ti Li (Form Branch) ===\\n\\n\\n==== Popular Xingshi Pai (形勢派) \"forms\" methods ====\\nLuan Tou Pai, 巒頭派, Pinyin: luán tóu pài, (environmental analysis without using a compass)\\nXing Xiang Pai, 形象派 or 形像派, Pinyin: xíng xiàng pài, (Imaging forms)\\nXingfa Pai, 形法派, Pinyin: xíng fǎ pài\\n\\n\\n=== Liiqi Pai (Compass Branch) ===\\n\\n\\n==== Popular Liiqi Pai (理气派) \"Compass\" methods ====\\nSan Yuan Method, 三元派 (Pinyin: sān yuán pài)\\n\\nDragon Gate Eight Formation, 龍門八法 (Pinyin: lóng mén bā fǎ)\\nXuan Kong, 玄空 (time and space methods)\\nXuan Kong Fei Xing 玄空飛星 (Flying Stars methods of time and directions)\\nXuan Kong Da Gua, 玄空大卦 (\"Secret Decree\" or 64 gua relationships)\\nXuan Kong Mi Zi, 玄空秘旨 (Mysterious Space Secret Decree)\\nXuan Kong Liu Fa, 玄空六法 (Mysterious Space Six Techniques)\\nZi Bai Jue, 紫白訣 (Purple White Scroll)\\nSan He Method, 三合派 (environmental analysis using a compass)\\n\\nAccessing Dragon Methods\\nBa Zhai, 八宅 (Eight Mansions)\\nYang Gong Feng Shui, 楊公風水\\nWater Methods, 河洛水法\\nLocal Embrace\\nOthers\\n\\nYin House Feng Shui, 陰宅風水 (Feng Shui for the deceased)\\nFour Pillars of Destiny, 四柱命理 (a form of hemerology)\\nZi Wei Dou Shu, 紫微斗數 (Purple Star Astrology)\\nI-Ching, 易經 (Book of Changes)\\nQi Men Dun Jia, 奇門遁甲 (Mysterious Door Escaping Techniques)\\nDa Liu Ren, 大六壬 (Divination: Big Six Heavenly Yang Water Qi)\\nTai Yi Shen Shu, 太乙神數 (Divination: Tai Yi Magical Calculation Method)\\nDate Selection, 擇日 (Selection of auspicious dates and times for important events)\\nChinese Palmistry, 掌相學 (Destiny reading by palm reading)\\nChinese Face Reading, 面相學 (Destiny reading by face reading)\\nMajor & Minor Wandering Stars (Constellations)\\nFive phases, 五行 (relationship of the five phases or wuxing)\\nBTB Black (Hat) Tantric Buddhist Sect (Westernised or Modern methods not based on Classical teachings)\\nSymbolic Feng Shui, (New Age Feng Shui methods that advocate substitution with symbolic (spiritual, appropriate representation of five elements) objects if natural environment or object/s is/are not available or viable)\\nPierce Method of Feng Shui ( Sometimes Pronounced : Von Shway ) The practice of melding striking with soothing furniture arrangements to promote peace and prosperity\\n\\n\\n== Traditional uses of feng shui ==\\n\\n\\n=== Environmental management ===\\nTraditional feng shui was a system designed to aid rural villages from the effects of weather and natural disaster. As a set of consistent rules, feng shui can facilitate collective consensus on development without the need of centralized leadership. Understanding that one\\'s actions could damage the feng shui and fortunes of the entire village, individuals were incentivized to know these rules and carefully manage the development of their land and resources. This served to prevent the Tragedy of the Commons. When conflict did erupt during development, feng shui experts played an important role in balancing interests and enforcing orderly development.\\nDifferent branches of feng shui were developed and embraced in response to differing local geographies. In southern China, this often resulted in villages located on high hills safe from flooding and erosion, with pooling streams that allow for easy irrigation and drainage, fields downstream fertilized by sewage, and graves located on the highest hills far from water and on otherwise unvaluable farmland. To this degree, feng shui could help communities manage their spaces to match their physical, environmental, and aesthetic needs.\\n\\n\\n=== Conflict resolution ===\\nA core aspect of feng shui has been its understanding of polarity. As opposed to western dualism, in which concepts are completely oppositional and irreconcilable, Chinese polarity sees opposing concepts as constantly changing and inseparable. The result is an emphasis on continual compromise and balance in order to maintain harmony.\\nFeng shui has been observed to play an important role in the mediation of rural conflict. Through its amoral explanation of differential fortunes, feng shui provides a universal set of cosmic rules communities seek to abide by. This can promote community unity while also creating numerous points of polarization. Through the hiring of feng shui experts, disputes between villagers can be peaceably resolved without losing face. In addition, these impersonal cosmic rules help regulate local jealousies over wealth and prestige.\\n\\n\\n=== Community mobilization and political protest ===\\nAs early as the Tang dynasty, the Chinese state recognized the disruptive power popular expressions of feng shui had over government authority. At the community level, feng shui could play an important role in community mobilization and political protest. By elevating a cosmological explanations of events, feng shui allowed for the expression of otherwise impermissible political opinions.\\nDuring the Boxer Rebellion, feng shui was used to justify attacks on western missionaries and colonial infrastructure. Under the perceptions of these infrastructural projects and groups were generating bad feng shui, rebels were able to incite their local communities into revolt against foreign influence.\\nTo a more civil degree, feng shui could facilitate community negotiation. During the development of the Shek Pik Reservoir, feng shui was used to rally the community against the reservoir and hinder construction. It was only after months of difficult negotiations that guaranteed of local oversight, compensation, and resettlement could construction go smoothly. For many communities, feng shui is a method to extract proper deference and compensation from the government.\\n\\n\\n=== Expression of identity ===\\nFeng shui has been described as an egocentric tradition. Because of the nature of fortune, one person\\'s gain comes at another\\'s expense. Thus when compared to the more collectivist traditions of Confucianism, feng shui promotes social competition and the atomization of the family structure. This differentiation has been particularly expressed through excellent siting and the building of bigger homes that can change the local balance of feng shui.\\nFeng shui also helps promote ethnic differentiation. In Southern China, different folk traditions and beliefs guide differing interpretations of feng shui. Through conflicts over burial sites, these contrasting interpretations of feng shui act as an important medium to settle interethnic disputes and define local dynamics.\\n\\n\\n== Contemporary uses of feng shui ==\\n\\nAfter Richard Nixon\\'s visit to the People\\'s Republic of China in 1972, feng shui practices became popular in the United States. Critics warn that claims of scientific validity have proven to be false and that the practices are pseudoscientific. Others charge that it has been reinvented and commercialized by New Age entrepreneurs, or are concerned that much of the traditional theory has been lost in translation, not given proper consideration, frowned upon, or scorned.\\nFeng shui has nonetheless found many uses. Landscape ecologists often find traditional feng shui an interesting study. In many cases, the only remaining patches of Asian old forest  are \"feng shui woods,\" associated with cultural heritage, historical continuity, and the preservation of various flora and fauna species. Some researchers interpret the presence of these woods as indicators that the \"healthy homes,\" sustainability  and environmental components of traditional feng shui should not be easily dismissed. Environmental scientists and landscape architects have researched traditional feng shui and its methodologies. Architects study feng shui as an Asian architectural tradition. Geographers have analyzed the techniques and methods to help locate historical sites in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, and archaeological sites in the American Southwest, concluding that Native Americans also considered astronomy and landscape features.\\nBelievers use it for healing purposes, to guide their businesses, or to create a peaceful atmosphere in their homes, although there is no empirical evidence that it is effective. In particular, they use feng shui in the bedroom, where a number of techniques involving colors and arrangement are thought to promote comfort and peaceful sleep. Some users of feng shui may be trying to gain a sense of security or control, for example by choosing auspicious numbers for their phones or favorable house locations. Their motivation is similar to the reasons that some people consult fortune-tellers.\\nIn 2005, Hong Kong Disneyland acknowledged feng shui as an important part of Chinese culture by shifting the main gate by twelve degrees in their building plans. This was among actions suggested by the planner of architecture and design at Walt Disney Imagineering, Wing Chao. At Singapore Polytechnic and other institutions, professionals including engineers, architects, property agents and interior designers, take courses on feng shui and divination every year, a number of whom become part-time or full-time feng shui consultants.\\n\\n\\n== Criticisms ==\\n\\n\\n=== Traditional feng shui ===\\nMatteo Ricci (1552–1610), one of the founding fathers of Jesuit China missions, may have been the first European to write about feng shui practices. His account in De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas tells about feng shui masters (geologi, in Latin) studying prospective construction sites or grave sites \"with reference to the head and the tail and the feet of the particular dragons which are supposed to dwell beneath that spot.\" As a Catholic missionary, Ricci strongly criticized the \"recondite science\" of geomancy along with astrology as yet another superstitio absurdissima of the heathens: \"What could be more absurd than their imagining that the safety of a family, honors, and their entire existence must depend upon such trifles as a door being opened from one side or another, as rain falling into a courtyard from the right or from the left, a window opened here or there, or one roof being higher than another?\"\\nVictorian-era commentators on feng shui were generally ethnocentric, and as such skeptical and derogatory of what they knew of feng shui. In 1896, at a meeting of the Educational Association of China, Rev. P. W. Pitcher railed at the \"rottenness of the whole scheme of Chinese architecture,\" and urged fellow missionaries \"to erect unabashedly Western edifices of several stories and with towering spires in order to destroy nonsense about fung-shuy.\"\\n\\nAfter the founding of the People\\'s Republic of China in 1949, feng shui was officially considered a \"feudalistic superstitious practice\" and a \"social evil\" according to the state\\'s ideology and was discouraged and even banned outright at times. Feng shui remained popular in Hong Kong, and also in the Republic of China (Taiwan), where traditional culture was not suppressed.\\nDuring the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) feng shui was classified as one of the so-called Four Olds that were to be wiped out. Feng shui practitioners were beaten and abused by Red Guards and their works burned. After the death of Mao Zedong and the end of the Cultural Revolution, the official attitude became more tolerant but restrictions on feng shui practice are still in place in today\\'s China. It is illegal in the PRC today to register feng shui consultation as a business and similarly advertising feng shui practice is banned. There have been frequent crackdowns on feng shui practitioners on the grounds of \"promoting feudalistic superstitions\" such as one in Qingdao in early 2006 when the city\\'s business and industrial administration office shut down an art gallery converted into a feng shui practice. Some officials who had consulted feng shui were terminated and expelled from the Communist Party.\\nIn 21st century mainland China less than one-third of the population believe in feng shui, and the proportion of believers among young urban Chinese is said to be even lower. Chinese academics permitted to research feng shui are anthropologists or architects by profession, studying the history of feng shui or historical feng shui theories behind the design of heritage buildings. They include Cai Dafeng, vice-president of Fudan University.  Learning in order to practice feng shui is still somewhat considered taboo. Nevertheless, it is reported that feng shui has gained adherents among Communist Party officials according to a BBC Chinese news commentary in 2006, and since the beginning of Chinese economic reforms the number of feng shui practitioners is increasing.\\n\\n\\n=== Contemporary feng shui ===\\nOne critic called the situation of feng shui in today\\'s world \"ludicrous and confusing,\" asking \"Do we really believe that mirrors and flutes are going to change people\\'s tendencies in any lasting and meaningful way?\" He called for much further study or \"we will all go down the tubes because of our inability to match our exaggerated claims with lasting changes.\" Robert T. Carroll sums up the charges:\\n\\n...feng shui has become an aspect of interior decorating in the Western world and alleged masters of feng shui now hire themselves out for hefty sums to tell people such as Donald Trump which way his doors and other things should hang. Feng shui has also become another New Age \"energy\" scam with arrays of metaphysical products...offered for sale to help you improve your health, maximize your potential, and guarantee fulfillment of some fortune cookie philosophy.\\nSkeptics charge that evidence for its effectiveness is based primarily upon anecdote and users are often offered conflicting advice from different practitioners, though feng shui practitioners use these differences as evidence of variations in practice or different branches of thought. A critical analyst concluded that \"Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork.\" Another objection was to the compass, a traditional tool for choosing favorable locations for property or burials. Critics point out that the compass degrees are often inaccurate because solar winds disturb the electromagnetic field of the Earth. Magnetic North on the compass will be inaccurate because true magnetic north fluctuates.\\nThe American magicians Penn and Teller dedicated an episode of their Bullshit! television show to criticize the acceptance of feng shui in the Western world as science. They devised a test in which the same dwelling was visited by five different feng shui consultants: each produced a different opinion about the dwelling, showing there is no consistency in the professional practice of feng shui.\\nFeng shui is criticized by Christians around the world. Some have argued that it is \"entirely inconsistent with Christianity to believe that harmony and balance result from the manipulation and channeling of nonphysical forces or energies, or that such can be done by means of the proper placement of physical objects. Such techniques, in fact, belong to the world of sorcery.\"\\nFeng shui practitioners in China have found officials that are considered superstitious and corrupt easily interested, despite official disapproval. In one instance, in 2009, county officials in Gansu, on the advice of feng shui practitioners, spent $732,000 to haul a 369-ton \"spirit rock\" to the county seat to ward off \"bad luck.\" Feng shui may require social influence or money because experts, architecture or design changes, and moving from place to place is expensive. Less influential or less wealthy people lose faith in feng shui, saying that it is a game only for the wealthy. Others, however, practice less expensive forms of feng shui, including hanging special (but cheap) mirrors, forks, or woks in doorways to deflect negative energy.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Sources ==\\n\\n\\n=== Books ===\\nAllan, Sarah (1991).

      "What are some risk factors for developing diabetes? Diabetes is a disease that affects the body’s ability to produce or use insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose (sugar) for energy. When you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t produce enough insulin or can’t use it properly. This causes high blood sugar levels.\n",
      "There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that usually develops in children and young adults. It occurs when the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes and usually develops in adults over the age of 40. It occurs when the body doesn’t produce enough insulin or when the body’s cells don’t respond to insulin properly.\n",

      "What are some risk factors for developing diabetes? Diabetes is a disease that affects the body’s ability to produce or use insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose (sugar) for energy. When you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t produce enough insulin or can’t use it properly. This causes high blood sugar levels.\n",
      "There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that usually develops in children and young adults. It occurs when the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes and usually develops in adults over the age of 40. It occurs when the body doesn’t produce enough insulin or when the body’s cells don’t respond to insulin properly.\n",
      "There are many risk factors for developing diabetes. Some of these risk factors include being overweight or obese,\n",
